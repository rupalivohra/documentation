It is absolutely possible for a technology company to curate operating processes that optimally address security risks, processing integrity, product availability, and user privacy and confidentiality without even thinking about compliance.

But is it likely that will happen organically or be maintainable as the company grows, or adjusts to meet market demands?
No.
It requires a significant level of contribution and coordination from several experienced individuals to do that in even a small 20-50 person company.
People come and go, products change, processes change, user needs change.
It is possible, but nearly improbable to maintain and scale best practices in such a dynamic environment.

Enter the Service Organization Control 2 framework (SOC 2).
While the name of the framework is not very attractive to most of us, the idea behind it is sound and simple.
The SOC 2 framework is just a list of criteria, established by the technology service industry, that represents best practices and guiding principles.

The idea is that an organization can map their current processes to the list of criteria as a way to validate what they are doing is ideal, or find gaps that could potentially leave them exposed.

To ensure that mapping is done in an objective fashion you can pay a third party organization called an "auditor" to review your organization's processes and issue a report on their findings.

This is where the term "control" is introduced.
A Control is a statement that captures the essence of what an organization does, the behavior, if you will, of some aspect of the organization.
Controls can be broad, or extremely granular in scope.
For example, a more broad control might be one that declares that the "organization conducts a formal risk assessment every 6 months", while a more granular control might declare that "a vulnerability scan is performed on the code base for every change that is requested to be merged into the main branch of the core SaaS repository".

An auditor looks at the set of controls that the organization has declared, maps them to the SOC 2 criteria, ensures there are no gaps of coverage, and then analyzes "evidence" to determine whether the organization is adhering to their control declarations.
They also review and include in their report a "system description" of the organization, that describes things in a fairly high degree of detail.
The report that the auditor issues is subsequently, more often than not, an extremely comprehensive analysis and honest view of the organization and how it operates.

Therefore, in recent years, a SOC 2 report has become a cornerstone factor in whether a customer decides to place their trust in the organization.
In fact, now-a-days many businesses won't even consider a B2B relationship if the other business is not SOC 2 compliant.

It is this exact reason why Temporal, as a startup-level business, decided to prioritize SOC 2 compliance early on.
We knew that a SOC 2 report would serve as a confidence booster for our customers, and cut through a lot of the red tape that is otherwise associated with B2B relationships.
We also hoped that the compliance process would help us organize ourselves internally to optimally reduce our exposure to risks and provide the best experience for our customers, which it did.

## Type 1 vs Type 2

There are two types of SOC 2 reports.
A Type 1 is a report that identifies compliance at a very specific point in time.
For example if a Type 1 report is issued for March 31st 2021, then that means that on March 31st 2021, the organization appeared to be compliant with its control declarations.
When it comes to evidence gathering and analysis, it is easy to cherry pick in order to satisfy the control declaration.
For example, if the control declaration states that "new employees agree to and sign an employee handbook", you really only need to provide one example of that happening to satisfy the audit.

Because of this, there is usually a lot less friction in acquiring a SOC2 Type 1 report as a startup-level organization.
The lower friction of a Type 1 means that you can use the audit as an exercise to identify your processes that can be captured as a control, and build up around the gaps.

A Type 2 report identifies compliance throughout a 6-12 month period of time.
The organization can choose the period.
What makes it more challenging is that the organization must be able to show that they adhering to their control declarations 100% of the time during that period.
This means that for the same control that states "new employees agree to and sign an employee handbook", you must be able to show evidence that every single employee who joined the company in the period has signed the most recent version of the employee handbook.
The auditors may not review each an every one, but their sampling is random.

Because of this, a startup-level organization should only really attempt a Type 2 if the scope of the business is limited, there is minimal exposure to risk, and/or they have had enough time to establish and strictly adhere to internal processes that are industry standard best practices.

At Temporal, we started with a Type 1 and used it as a way to build up to our Type 2.

## Starting with a Type 1

Experience is the ultimate teacher.
At Temporal, when we started looking at becoming SOC 2 compliant in late 2020, but iternally we did not have a lot of experience with the process though.
For this reason we networked to find someone who did, to help us out.

Enter [Strike Graph](https://www.strikegraph.com/).
Strike Graph is a company that provides their own "framework" for building up a control library and a UI to do it in.

Their strategy is based on a risk assessment, what they call a "risk-based" approach.
Their team has compiled a library of general risks, controls, and types of evidence that are common in the SOC 2 domain.
By assessing potential risks and selecting control declarations that "mitigate" a given risk, it is possible get a solid foundation going.

In this respect, credit is due where credit is earned.
Strike Graph's "risk-based" approach did help us build a solid foundation for us to work from.
Their team provided templates for policies, and also put us in touch with an auditing firm that they recommended, [Connor Consulting](https://www.connor-consulting.com/).

The effort was successful, for in February of 2021, we received a clean SOC 2 Type 1 Security report issued for January 31, 2021.
However, by the end of our audit, the smooth experience had eroded significantly, uncovering the real truths about what makes an organization successful in the eyes of the SOC 2 framework.

## Aiming for the Type 2

As stated previously, experience is the ultimate teacher.
And our experience with the Type 1 process taught us what we needed to know to move towards our Type 2.

Its probably not surprising in retrospect, but the biggest thing we learned is that the internal culture of the organization, and its fundamental understanding and commitment to the SOC 2 framework, is what ultimately makes an audit feel like a smooth routine exercise, versus a slogging and demoralizing haze.

For an organization, SOC 2 compliance is essentially a day to day way of life.

### The keys to success









However, there were some very practical




Temporal's SOC 2 Type 2 July 31st report was issued on ____.
It indicates that from, January 31st to July 31st 2021, Temporal Technologies was compliant in doing all the things we say we do in order to maintain a secure, reliable, available, and confidential operation.
This report is a significant factor in boosting the confidence level of our customers when it comes to using our SaaS product.

## Notable gaps that were filled

This was our first Type 2.

The company received a Type 1 report for January 31 2021. A Type 1 report reflects compliance at a singular point in time, while a Type 2 reflects compliance over a given period of time. In that respect it is typically, "harder" to get a Type 2 because we need to be able to show we have met control specifications for the entire period, not just at one point.

Additionally, for our Type 1 we only went for Security compliance. In our Type 2, we went for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality, which adds additional scrutiny to our controls and how well we are meeting those control specifications.

As a result, we ended up filling some "gaps" in our policies and processes. There will be fewer gaps to fill the next time around (if any).

- Updated Risk Assessment Process & Policy
- Updated Data Classification Policy
- New Vulnerability Management Policy
- New Business Continuity Plan
- Formation of ISMS Committee

# Keys to success

## **Doing what we say we are doing**

Internal understanding of why we do the things we do is critical to long term compliance success. Each member of the compliance effort, particularly department heads, can take credit for aligning their understanding of the needs of the business, the needs of our customers, and our policies such that our operation is secure, reliable, available, and confidential.

## **Mapping our efforts to SOC 2 criteria**

One of the hardest parts of SOC 2 compliance is mapping our internal efforts (the things we do), to compliance criteria for auditing purposes. For the most recent period, we brought on Martin Cozzi as a consultant. Without Martin's expertise in this area, it is hard to imagine that things would have gone as smoothly as they did. Martin rewrote the wording of all of our controls so that they accurately reflected the things we and applied them to appropriate criteria. He also was able to identify potential gaps where additional controls might be  needed. This is the critical part that Strike Graph tried to do for us on the Type 1. Strike Graph's "risk based" approach did get us rolling, but there were too many gaps and ambiguous signals from that approach that would not scale well to a Type 2.

## **Internal management of controls and resources**

For the Type 1, all of our control descriptions, risk assessment info, and evidence gathering was done via the Strike Graph portal. For the Type 2, Martin Cozzi guided us on how to manage all of this internally using Google spreadsheets and Notion. This was a FAR better way to move through the period, as everyone had access to the SOC 2 process information and all controls could be linked to internally and evidence could be gathered right on the control page. We were able to use familiar tools that didn't have severe UX limitations (unlike Strike Graph). In general this approach puts the process right in the middle of our organization - making compliance a factor that is more readily taken into account when making decisions.

## **Reliable auditing partner**

Schneider Downs turned out to be a really good auditing partner. They were recommended by Martin Cozzi. Martin has worked with them for a few years and has a good understanding of how they operate and what they look for. Martin's relationship with them helped him to map controls to criteria and identify potential gaps that Schneider Downs would typically be looking at. Schneider Downs was also very responsive in terms of communication - said another way, they were great at boiling down ambiguity into clear action steps with us. This was a great improvement in experience from our last auditing partner Connor Consulting. Additionally, Schneider Downs used Suralink for evidence management during the audit itself. This made the entire audit process transparent and state of things became very easy to understand.

## We spread out the workload

The company grew significantly during the period, and as a result we had more people to take on different roles and spread out the Workload.

There are four roles that any given person of the compliance effort could fall under at any given time.

### Compliance Expert

This is the person that has the most experience with this process and guides the overall strategy. This includes strong opinions and recommendations around auditing partners (who we work with), compliance resource management (where and how we store our stuff), control descriptions (how we phrase what we are doing), and timeline (when we should be doing what). This was what Martin Cozzi did for us.

### **Department head**

This is a very important role. As the head of any given department, it is their responsibility to make sure things are getting done the way we say we are doing them and ensure there are people doing them. The department head must have a good sense of their controls and requirements behind those controls to make sure proper actions are taking place and proper evidence is gathered at the right time. Robert Entenman, Mike McBryde, Samar Abbas, and Karl Augustine acted in this role through out this period.

### Project manager

This was all about scheduling meetings, engaging individuals, providing guidance on the process, and creating a general structure to operate in. Cully Wakelin (myself) was most often the one in this position, but Robert Entenman, Mike McBryde, and Martin Cozzi were key supporting roles to this.

### Evidence gather

This is someone who captured evidence per an evidence request for the auditing process. We had to submit well over a hundred pieces of evidence, most of them unique, and some large in scope. An evidence gather must be someone who is familiar enough with the domain in order to know what to gather and how to gather it and work with both the Project Manager(s) and the Department Head(s) to do that. This role was often performed by almost everyone involved with the auditing process. This included but was not limited to: Cully Wakelin, Robert Entenman, Martin Cozzi, Mike McBryde, Samar Abbas, Derek Wilson, Jeremy, Jennifer, Karl Augustine, Manu Srivastava, and Sergey Bykov.

## **General project management**

Between Cully Wakelin (myself) & Martin Cozzi, there was an effective level of engagement, both internally and externally, and there was a structure in which to progress through the auditing period, such that all action items were addressed in a timely, and efficient manner. In essence, it is clear that having at least 1 person remain responsible and accountable for driving compliance related efforts is important to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

# Recommendations for the next period

- Continue to retain Martin Cozzi for ***at least*** 1 more period. Martin has indicated that he has a flexible fee structure depending on our specific needs. We may be able to reduce our costs by redefining or exact needs from him. However, it may still take at least 1-2 more period of consultation for us to inherit the skills needed to handle the process completely on our own without a consultant like Martin. We need to see what our customer growth and customer needs looks like over the next period, for if we end up needing to define new controls, having Martin will make things a lot easier. Eventually, there will be a point where we could have someone be a full time internal compliance lead (do what both Cully & Martin do Project Manager + Compliance Expert)
- Aim to use Schneider Downs for the next audit. Now that they know us, and we have history with them, the next audit should be even more smooth and less intensive. Changing auditors can cause disruption - lets stick with Schneider Downs to see how smooth we can make things.
- Some of our compliance resources are still defined in a Google spreadsheet - We should just bring that all in-line with Notion. This would make it even easier to keep track of everything (calendar, criteria, notes etc).
